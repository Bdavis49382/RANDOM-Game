# RANDOM-Game
## *A game that never stays the same*: Built for 8 Bits to Infinity Game Jam: July 14-24

#### Day 1
Decided on the idea for my game. The game itself will be fluid and random, with everything changing every level that you complete. One moment you'll be a brave
adventurer trying to survive hordes of goblins with only your bare hands, the other you'll be stealing a historical artifact from a spaceship filled with zombies
using your handy dandy laser gun.

After determining the basic idea, I got started setting up my pygame environment. I created basic classes for the tilemaps and the players. I'm making all the 
assets myself so they frankly look pretty horrible, but at least they're something to work with! By the end of the day
I had a working map and an animated player which can move around and collide with certain tiles. Also invested some time in making an 'editor mode' so that I can
change my tilemaps at will to be whatever I want.
